**There is a port available for Rasperry Pi: https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi**

# Info #
**Send RC codes**

Use your Arduino to operate remote radio controlled devices. This will most likely work with all popular low cost power outlet sockets.

All you need is a Arduino, a 315/433MHz AM transmitter (find out [where to get one](List_TransmitterReceiverModules.md) or [hack your existing remote control](HowTo_HackRemoteControl.md)) and one or more devices with a SC5262 / SC5272, HX2262 / HX2272, PT2262 / PT2272, EV1527, RT1527, FP1527 or HS1527 chipset. Also supports Intertechno outlets.

**Receive and decode RC codes**

Find out what codes your remote is sending. Use your remote to control your Arduino.

All you need is a Arduino, a 315/433MHz AM receiver (altough there is no instruction yet, yes it is possible to hack an existing device) and a remote hand set.
